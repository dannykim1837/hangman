## Overview

**Project Title**: Hangman game

**Project Description**: The Hangman game project in C++ aims to create a fun and easy word-guessing game. Players can choose the length of the word to guess, from 3 to 8 letters, with many words to keep the game interesting. The game has a simple command-line interface that shows the current word, guessed letters, and remaining tries

**Project Goals**: 
The main goal of this Hangman game project in C++ is to create a fun and customizable game for players. Users will be able to choose how many letters are in the word they want to guess, from 3 to 8 letters, with a variety of words to make the game interesting each time they play. The game will have a simple command-line interface that shows the current state of the word, the letters guessed, and the remaining chances. Using data structures from the Standard Template Library (STL), like vectors and sets, the game will efficiently manage the word list and guessed letters. The project will also focus on handling errors well so the game runs smoothly without crashing. We will test the game thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Clear documentation and good coding practices will be followed to make the code easy to understand and maintain. This project aims to deliver a well-made and enjoyable Hangman game that demonstrates the capabilities of C++.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I want to create a GUI and modify the ui of the start screen and game screen
* [ ] I want to add a score system so that the user can save the highest score or record achieved in the previous game and see it in the next game
* [ ] It adds the ability to get hints when the user wants. For example, it can provide hints such as showing the first letter of a word.
